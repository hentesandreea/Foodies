<h1>Christmas food cards application</h1>
<p>This is a small application in which I used stack navigation to navigate between the 3 screens.</p>
<p>In this application you can find  cards with recipe suggestions for desserts and main dishes</p>
<ul>
<li>Main screen</li>

<li>Desserts screen</li>

</ul>
